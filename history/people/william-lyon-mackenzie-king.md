William Lyon Mackenzie King (1874-1950) was Canada's tenth Prime Minister and the longest-serving Prime Minister in Canadian history. His grandfather was William Lyon Mackenzie, the leader of the 1837 Rebellion in Upper Canada, who would go onto be a major influence on Mackenzie King. A member of the Liberal Party, he significantly reduced war debt after the First World War, stayed out of power during the Great Depression, and then served again during the Second World War. Canada assisted the Allied forces during the war due in part to Mackenzie King's strong relationship with Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt. Mackenzie King established Canada as a middle power during WWII and negotiated the idea of conscription, which became hugely unpopular after WWI. After the war, King signed the United Nations Charter on behalf of Canada in June 1945.He also presided over the Japanese internment camps instituted in Canada in 1941 and so Japanese citizens did not become enfranchised citizens until 1949, a year after Mackenzie King's retirement.
